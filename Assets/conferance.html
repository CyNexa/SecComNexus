                        <p>
                            As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, traditional security models are often no longer enough. In this session, Professor [Name] will explain the concept of Zero Trust Architecture, a model that assumes every access request could be a potential risk. Rather than automatically trusting anyone inside the network, Zero Trust verifies every user and device to prevent breaches and minimize access to critical data. Attendees will learn about the key principles of Zero Trust, how to implement this security-first model, and the benefits of adopting it to strengthen organizational defenses.

                            Staying a step ahead of cybercriminals requires more than just reactive security; it demands proactive defense. Professor [Name] will discuss the role of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) in identifying, analyzing, and mitigating potential threats before they can cause harm. This session will cover how CTI gathers information about emerging threats, provides context on attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures, and enables organizations to prepare and respond effectively. Attendees will learn about the various types of threat intelligence and how to integrate CTI into their organization’s overall cybersecurity strategy.
