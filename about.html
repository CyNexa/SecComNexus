            Welcome to the Department of Cyber Science & Technology (CST). Cyber Science being the essence of
            today’s world, we are committed to provide not only the technical education to our students but also the
            leadership qualities through which they can create employment to others

          <p>
            Brainware University Kolkata, a part of a 35-year-old leading education group, Brainware of West Bengal,
            started with the aim of contributing to nation-building through research, innovation and quality education.
            For over 35 years now, more than 2 lakh students have passed out from Brainware. Most of them are now
            well-established and thriving. As a department, Cyber Science & Technology was introduced on 1st
            January, 2020. It was previously operated as a programme under the Dept. of Computational Science
            since the beginning of the University. The Department currently runs academic Bachelor's and Master's
            degree programmes in Advanced Networking and Cyber Security. Among our immediate vision is to blend
            research and technology to drive the information technology industries and champion the course of
            moving the university upwards to become a research hub in cybersecurity and digital forensic
            technologies. Potential partners and collaborators are therefore invited to help build a strengthened
            department with every capacity to train the next generation cybersecurity and networking who will be up to
            the task to design, implement and oversee cybersecurity applications software for society
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Once again, I welcome you to this department and we are open to collaborate with all stakeholders that
            are willing to make the vision and mission of the department a reality.
          </p>
